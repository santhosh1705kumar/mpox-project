        <h1>Learn More About Monkey Pox</h1>
        <p>Monkeypox is a rare viral disease that occurs mainly in remote parts of Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests. The monkeypox virus can cause a severe illness in humans, and it's similar to smallpox, but milder. Here are some key points to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. The main difference between monkeypox and smallpox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell (lymphadenopathy).</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> The monkeypox virus can spread to humans from animals such as rodents and primates, or through contact with bodily fluids of infected humans. It can also be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets or close contact with infected skin lesions.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Preventive measures include avoiding contact with animals that could harbor the virus, practicing good hygiene, and getting vaccinated against smallpox if you live in or travel to areas where monkeypox is endemic.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> There's no specific treatment for monkeypox, but supportive care and antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more detailed information about monkeypox, its symptoms, transmission, prevention, and treatment, please visit reputable health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
