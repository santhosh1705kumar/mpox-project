        <h1>Preventive Measures for Monkeypox</h1>
        <p>Monkeypox is a rare viral disease that can be prevented by taking certain precautions. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
        <h2>Avoid Close Contact with Infected Animals</h2>
        <p>Monkeypox can be transmitted to humans through close contact with infected animals, particularly rodents. To reduce the risk of infection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid touching or handling wild animals, such as squirrels, rats, and monkeys.</li>
            <li>Avoid contact with blood, bodily fluids, or lesions of infected animals.</li>
            <li>If you work with animals or are in areas where monkeypox is prevalent, wear appropriate protective clothing and gear.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practice Good Hygiene</h2>
        <p>Practicing good hygiene can help prevent the spread of monkeypox. Here are some hygiene tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after contact with animals or animal products.</li>
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of tissues properly.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth, with unwashed hands.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stay Informed and Seek Medical Care</h2>
        <p>Stay informed about monkeypox outbreaks in your area and follow public health guidelines. If you develop symptoms of monkeypox, such as fever, rash, or swollen lymph nodes, seek medical care immediately.</p>
        <p>For more information about monkeypox and preventive measures, you can visit reputable sources such as the <a href="#">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> and the <a href="#">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.</p>
