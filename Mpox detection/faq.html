            <h2>Is There a Treatment for Monkeypox?</h2>
            <p class="answer">There's no specific treatment for monkeypox, but supportive care and antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.</p>
            
            <h2>How Can Monkeypox be Prevented?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Preventive measures include avoiding contact with animals that could harbor the virus, practicing good hygiene, and getting vaccinated against smallpox if you live in or travel to areas where monkeypox is endemic.</p>
            
            <h2>Where Can I Get More Information?</h2>
            <p class="answer">For more information about monkeypox, its symptoms, transmission, prevention, and treatment, you can visit reputable health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
